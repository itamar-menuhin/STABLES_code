calc_features_disorder.py - Protein disorder feature calculation module

This module calculates protein disorder features that characterize the
intrinsically disordered regions of proteins. Protein disorder can
significantly impact expression levels, degradation rates, and
protein function.

The key features calculated include:
- Average disorder scores for the entire protein and specific regions
- Percentage of disordered residues in various protein regions
