# STABLES: AI-Directed Gene Fusion for Evolutionary Stability

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for the study:

**AI-directed gene fusing prolongs the evolutionary half-life of synthetic gene circuits**

STABLES (Stop-codon Tunable Alternative Bifunctional mRNA Leading to Expression and Stability) is a gene fusion strategy that links a gene of interest (GOI) to an essential endogenous gene (EG) via a “leaky” stop codon. This approach leverages machine learning to predict optimal GOI-EG pairs, select linkers to minimize misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* demonstrates substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin. The pipeline is scalable, adaptable, and organism-agnostic, with broad implications for synthetic biology and biotechnology.

This repository provides:
- Data processing and feature extraction scripts
- ML-based EG selection and linker optimization
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- All code and data supporting the results in the paper
