  ðŸ§¬ This release accompanies the publication:
  "AI-directed gene fusing prolongs the evolutionary half-life of synthetic gene circuits"
  by Menuhin-Gruman et al., Science Advances (2025).

  This repository includes code, processed data, model outputs, and experimental results
  supporting our study of synthetic gene stabilization through endogenous gene fusions
  and leaky stop codons in *S. cerevisiae*.

  For full reproducibility, see scripts for preprocessing, model training, SHAP analysis,
  linker optimization, and codon selection.
